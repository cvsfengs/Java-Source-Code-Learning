     * <p>Specifying a value of zero for the {@code stackSize} parameter will
     * cause this constructor to behave exactly like the
     * {@code Thread(ThreadGroup, Runnable, String)} constructor.
     *
     * <p><i>Due to the platform-dependent nature of the behavior of this
     * constructor, extreme care should be exercised in its use.
     * The thread stack size necessary to perform a given computation will
     * likely vary from one JRE implementation to another.  In light of this
     * variation, careful tuning of the stack size parameter may be required,
     * and the tuning may need to be repeated for each JRE implementation on
     * which an application is to run.</i>
     *
     * <p>Implementation note: Java platform implementers are encouraged to
     * document their implementation's behavior with respect to the
     * {@code stackSize} parameter.

     * @param  group
     *         the thread group. If {@code null} and there is a security
     *         manager, the group is determined by {@linkplain
     *         SecurityManager#getThreadGroup SecurityManager.getThreadGroup()}.
     *         If there is not a security manager or {@code
     *         SecurityManager.getThreadGroup()} returns {@code null}, the group
     *         is set to the current thread's thread group.
     *
     * @param  target
     *         the object whose {@code run} method is invoked when this thread
     *         is started. If {@code null}, this thread's run method is invoked.
     *
     * @param  name
     *         the name of the new thread
     *
     * @param  stackSize
     *         the desired stack size for the new thread, or zero to indicate
     *         that this parameter is to be ignored.
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          if the current thread cannot create a thread in the specified
     *          thread group
